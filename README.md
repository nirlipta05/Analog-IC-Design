# Analog-IC-Design
This repository contain the design,simulation and analysi of an interface circuit for a MEMS microphone,developed during an internship on Analog IC Design.The project involved:

* Modelling the MEMS microphone using its Thevenin equivalent
* Designing an op-amp based amplifier
* Performing circuit characterization using ngspice
* Implementing schematics using Xschem
***
## Thevenin equivalent model calculation
